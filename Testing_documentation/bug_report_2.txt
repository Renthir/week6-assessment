Bug Report for Test Case 2 - Dueling Wins/Losses

Description:
This test determines if the scoring system updates correctly when the user wins or loses a duel.

Steps:
1. Navigate to the website - *website
2. Click the button labeled "Draw" centered near the middle of the page.
3. Select any two bots by clicking on the "Add to Duo" button located on the bots' cards
4. Once two have been selected, the bottom of the page should have a button labeled 'Duel!' Click that button and wait for the page to update.
5. After a brief 'dueling' message, there should be a message in the middle of the page that alerts the user whether they won or lost.

Expected Result:
1. If the site shows the user has lost the duel, the Losses counter should increment by 1
2. If the site shows the user has won the duel, the Wins counter should increment by 1

Actual Result:
1. Whether the message tells the user they won or lost the duel, the Losses counter increments by 1
2. When the message tells the user they have won the duel, the Win counter remains at 0
